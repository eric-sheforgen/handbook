# Benefits & Perks

While benefits and perks are nice, we first and foremost try to ensure we are fair and transparent with pay (we don't think there's a point in giving you a free lunch if you aren't making enough to have dinner later!). 

That being said, a perk is definitely nice here and there. Annually we evaluate what we offer, comparing ourselves to others and considering what members of our team value. 

## Pension contributions

All team members are automatically enrolled in a workplace pension (unless you opt-out in your onboarding form). We will contribute 3% and you 5%. The short story is that it's like getting a 3% top-up. You can increase your contributions at any time but this must be done before the 10th of the month to take effect for the end of month pay period. 

## Holidays

We have 28 days holiday (inclusive of bank holidays in the UK) per year (starting in January through end of December) plus we also shut the office down during Christmas and don't count these days against your allocation. You'll accumulate holidays at the rate specified in your contract so if you join mid-way through the year, keep that in mind. 

## Free lunches

When we're in the office, we provide a free lunch three days a week. During the pandemic, we offered everyone a weekly Deliveroo of their choice. 

## Team outings

We like to celebrate the incredible work of the team and generally do this once a month by going out to enjoy a beverage at a local pub. 

## Twice annual parties

We appreciate the hard-work our team puts in and while we endeavour to say thanks and show this appreciation throughout the year, we take it up a level once sometime in the summer and another time around Christmas. We try to do something creative each time to gel as a team and have some fun together. 

## Gym contributions

We like to stay healthy and encourage our team to get fit. Outside of free credits we get from all the gyms we work with, we also contribute to gym memberships. If you would like to avail this, please send an email to Eric and Nathan and we'll look at the options. Generally, we contribute up to Â£20/month which you'd take as a taxable benefit or we also have a gym nearby the office that we can enroll you directly.
