# Getting Started

## Our onboarding process

twotwentyseven has grown a lot over the past couple of years which has meant welcomeing many new team members. Our processes have grown and changed as a result and we hope you find your onboarding both welcoming and supportive. If you ever have any feedback, don't hold on it! Get in touch with your team lead, Nathan or Eric at any point if there's ever anything we can be doing better. 

## Before you arrive

Before you start, you should expect to receive a couple of forms in addition to your contract (everything is sent and signed digitally). These forms contain some of the nitty gritty details to help us get you setup on payroll/pension but also include some lighter things like your spirit animal. 

You'll also get a company laptop and some equipment to help you get setup for hybrid working. 

If anything changes with your start date, please let your team lead know, and as always, reach out with questions at any point. 

## Your first month

The first month is all about learning our tools, processes and most importantly, getting to know the team. We'll encourage our team to reach out to you and have an informal chat whether in-person or virtually but we also equally ask you to take action and introduce yourself â€“ it can be awkward but hey, that will fade away with time.
