# A Note About Freelancing 

We recognise that many of our team members occassionally take on work outside of twotwentyseven. It sometimes helps bring in a little extra moola on the side for those treats or extra savings you're after. We support team members who want to take on some extra work but need to ensure we're clear on what we expect:

- Your twotwentyseven work is what's worked on during twotwentyseven time
- It can't impact your ability to deliver or affect performance
- There shouldn't be a conflict of interest (i.e. you're working for another agency)

Here's a few examples of what's okay vs definitely not okay

## Okay

1. An occassional side gig for a friend

5. Do volunteer or occasional pro-bono work for a cause you’re actively involved with. A little work here and there is fine, but, for example, becoming an organization’s full-time web designer and being on the hook to work during your standard work day, etc, would not be OK.

## Not okay

1. You can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry. If you’re unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation you’d like to talk about, ping Jason or David.

2. Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow teammates.

3. Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to Basecamp, etc).

4. Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.

5. Take on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That would ultimately be a problem.

## In general

Here are a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:

* Is it competitive?
* Does it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?
* Does it require you to be away during times when you’re needed at work?
* Is it another paid gig that employs the same skills Basecamp is paying you for?

In general, we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance here at work.

It’s hard to come up with one-size fits all rules. If you’re in doubt, please reach out to Jason or David. We’re always happy to spare a moment to give our thoughts on it before you make a commitment.
